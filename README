in the jni directory:
modify CMOSS_BIN_DRIOD variable in jni/Android.mk to where you installed cmoss
run build.sh in the jni folder

in the top folder:
edit build.properties with correct path to android SDK and NDK
run ant from the top dir

== Using

To use the the module in your Titanium Mobile Application, import the project to the same workspace in Titanium Studio.
Open both the module project and your application project. Build the module and specify the mobile application as the target.
The module will be installed into your app's modules.

For an example of how to use the otr module see the TEO project https://github.com/mnaamani/TEO/blob/master/titanium/src/ti-libotr4.js

Code from from jni can be imported into a native android project.
